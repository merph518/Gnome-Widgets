#
# A sparse checkout, which some workflows make on a reused runner workspace, clones
# without file contents and marks the workspace as a partial clone. A partial clone
# cannot serve the contents it lacks, so a consumer whose history needs one fails with
# "bad pack header". This script drops the mark and fetches every object from origin. A
# checkout that is not a partial clone is left as it is, with no network access.
#
#   GH_TOKEN   a token that can read origin on github.com; optional. It reaches git
#              through the environment for the one fetch, and nothing is written to the
#              repository's configuration.
