# Runner registration

All sixteen self-hosted runners register on the `merph518` organization, in its
Default runner group, so `Playwright-Testing` and `Overmind` draw on the same
machines. Labels decide which repository's jobs land where.

## The group and who may use it

`merph518` is on the free plan, which allows the Default group only: no custom
groups, and no limit on which repositories use it. Every private repository in
the organization can run jobs on every runner. Public repositories cannot,
unless the group's public-repository setting is turned on, and it stays off.

Separation is by label alone, an accepted trade-off. A workflow in any
repository that asks for `playwright` reaches the Playwright runners, so the
convention below is the only thing that keeps Overmind jobs off them. Account
leases still hold concurrent Playwright jobs apart whatever else is running,
since a lease is taken by the test, not by the runner.

| Runners | Labels | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pw-linux-runner-1` to `-6` | `self-hosted`, `Linux`, `X64`, `playwright` | `Playwright-Testing` |
| `pw-windows-runner-1` | `self-hosted`, `Windows`, `X64`, `playwright` | `Playwright-Testing` |
| `pw-ci-runner-desktop-1` to `-5` | `self-hosted`, `Windows`, `X64`, `ci`, `overmind` | `Playwright-Testing`, `Overmind` |
| `tablet-runner-1` to `-4` | `self-hosted`, `Linux`, `X64`, `ci`, `static-checks`, `overmind` | `Playwright-Testing`, `Overmind` |

The rules that keep this working:

- `Overmind` workflows target `runs-on: [self-hosted, overmind]` and
  never name `playwright`.
- `Playwright-Testing` workflows keep their labels as they are. Every `runs-on` under
  `.github/workflows` resolves against the table above with no edit.
- A new runner for Overmind work gets `overmind`; a new Playwright runner never
  does.

## Moving a runner from the repository to the organization

A configured runner cannot be configured again in place, so each one is
removed from `Playwright-Testing` and registered again on the organization under the same
name. The scripts do both halves and reinstall the service under the account
it already used.

1. Mint the two tokens on any machine signed in to `gh`. The organization token
   needs the `admin:org` scope (`gh auth refresh -h github.com -s admin:org`).
   Each lasts about an hour and covers every runner moved in that hour.

   ```bash
   gh api -X POST repos/merph518/Playwright-Testing/actions/runners/remove-token --jq .token
   gh api -X POST orgs/merph518/actions/runners/registration-token --jq .token
   ```

2. On the runner's machine, take the scripts from a fresh clone of `main` in
   the home folder (`git clone https://github.com/merph518/Playwright-Testing`), not from a
   runner's `_work` folder, which every job replaces with whatever branch it
   ran. Set the tokens as `REMOVE_TOKEN` and `REGISTER_TOKEN` in the shell,
   never in a file, and run the script once per runner folder with that
   runner's custom labels from the table. The script refuses a runner that is
   running a job. When a run fails after removing the repository registration,
   such as on an expired token, mint a new registration token and run the same
   command again: a `.move-to-org` file left in the folder lets it pick up at
   the registration. A runner registered under the repository's name before
   its transfer gets 404 from the removal; the script sets its registration
   files aside in `.repo-registration` and registers it anyway, and the
   repository's record of it is deleted by id afterwards:
   `gh api -X DELETE repos/merph518/Playwright-Testing/actions/runners/<id>`.

   ```bash
   scripts/move-runner-to-org.sh ~/actions-runner-1 playwright
   scripts/move-runner-to-org.sh ~/actions-runner ci,static-checks,overmind
   ```

   ```powershell
   scripts/move-runner-to-org.ps1 -Folder C:\actions-runner -Labels ci,overmind
   scripts/move-runner-to-org.ps1 -Folder C:\actions-runner -Labels playwright
   ```

   The Windows script reuses the old service's logon account and asks for its
   password at the prompt when it is not a built-in account.

3. Move one runner per label set at a time, so the pool keeps capacity for
   queued jobs while each one is between registrations.

### The Linux Playwright runners from a workflow

`Runner Move to Org (on demand)` moves `pw-linux-runner-1` to `-6` from a job
on one of them, with no shell on their machine. It reads the tokens from the
`RUNNER_REMOVE_TOKEN` and `RUNNER_REGISTER_TOKEN` repository secrets, so set
both just before the dispatch, piping each token straight into the secret:

```bash
gh api -X POST repos/merph518/Playwright-Testing/actions/runners/remove-token --jq .token |
  gh secret set RUNNER_REMOVE_TOKEN
gh api -X POST orgs/merph518/actions/runners/registration-token --jq .token |
  gh secret set RUNNER_REGISTER_TOKEN
gh workflow run runner-move-to-org.yml
```

The job moves every runner but its own and names that one in a notice.
Dispatch again with `-f runners=<n>` for it. A runner already on the
organization is left alone, so a repeat dispatch only finishes the move.
Delete both secrets once the six show online on the organization.

## Checking the move

- `gh api orgs/merph518/actions/runners --jq '.runners[] | "\(.name) \(.status) \([.labels[].name] | join(","))"'`
  lists all sixteen with their labels, and
  `gh api repos/merph518/Playwright-Testing/actions/runners --jq .total_count` reads `0`.
- `scripts/runner_status.py --text` lists the Linux Playwright runners from both
  lists. Without `admin:org` it shows only the repository's own runners, which
  is none after the move, and warns.
- Dispatch `Runner Service Restart`, `Runner Disk Cleanup`, and
  `Runner Memory Limit` once each. They target `[self-hosted, playwright, Linux]`,
  which the moved Linux runners still carry.
- Run a job in `Overmind` on `[self-hosted, overmind]`, and while it runs,
  dispatch `Playwright Debug (on demand)` on one spec with `workers=1` and
  `retries=1`. It should land on a `playwright` runner, pass, and log no lease
  timeout.

## Registering a new runner

New runners register on the organization from the start: the same
`config.sh --url https://github.com/merph518 --runnergroup Default` call the
scripts make, with an organization registration token and the labels from the
table.

## Docker on the tablet runners

A tablet runner needs Docker from the `docker.io` apt package
(`sudo apt install docker.io` when it is missing) for a job that builds or runs
a container. A job reaches the daemon through `/var/run/docker.sock`, which
only root and the `docker` group may open, so the runner's service account has
to be in that group.

Membership in the `docker` group is root-equivalent on the runner. For that
reason a workflow that uses Docker must skip pull requests from forks of a
private repository; nothing here enforces it, so each workflow does, for
example with
`if: github.event_name != 'pull_request' || github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository`
on the job.

On each tablet runner:

1. Add the account the runner service runs as (`michael`) to the group:
   `sudo usermod -aG docker michael`.
2. Restart the runner service from its folder:
   `sudo ./svc.sh stop && sudo ./svc.sh start`. A running service keeps the
   groups it started with, so a job fails with `permission denied` on the
   socket until it restarts.
3. Check it as that account: `docker info` should print the server details
   rather than a permission error. Do this on all four runners, not only one.
