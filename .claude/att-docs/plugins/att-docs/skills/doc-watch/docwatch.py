"""Compare the SharePoint documentation libraries with the converted set under the apps root.

  docwatch.py --config FILE SUBCOMMAND ...

Subcommands:
  payload       print page.js filled with the folder table, the readable formats and
                the provenance index
  compare FILE  classify the report page.js wrote, as JSON
  summary FILE  print a compare result as the plain-text run summary
  issue-body    render the tracking issue body from the todo root and a compare result
  place FILE    move approved downloads into the todo root, dropping re-saved documents,
                and each revision the web app does not carry yet (--future) into its
                Future folder
  link FILE     give each converted file a SharePoint line per source a links scan found
  index         print the provenance index as JSON
  check-config  check that every folder table row names a listed library and a known rule

FILE after --config is the skill's extension.json. A path in it is relative to the git
toplevel of the folder the file sits in. The fields:

  convert         convert-docs' extension.json, which names the todo root, the apps root,
                  the Future folder and the SharePoint host
  libraries       library key -> [web, library title]; the key "" is the default library
  suites          one-character suite code -> suite name, as folder table rows name them
  folders         the folder table
  sources         the table of the folder each repeated source name was converted from
  ignored         the table of library files to pass over
  notFromLibrary  optional pattern for source names that never came from a library

A missing config, or a field it lacks or misstates, exits 64.
