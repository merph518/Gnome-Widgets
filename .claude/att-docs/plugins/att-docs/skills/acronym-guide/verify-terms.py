"""Reads every row of the dictionary and checks the file in its fourth column
actually states that expansion for that acronym.

    verify-terms.py --config <file>

The config names the dictionary (terms); a source path in a row is relative
to the config's git toplevel. See config.py.

A row passes when the cited file carries the acronym and the expansion close
enough together to be one statement: a glossary heading, a table row, or the
parenthesis a document opens the first time it uses the short form. Capitals,
punctuation, "and" against "&", and a possessive apostrophe do not count
against it, and the words may sit up to two words apart, which covers a
document breaking the phrase across a line.

The expansion appearing somewhere else in the file is not enough. A file can
say "Adoptive Parent" about one code and use a different code two pages later,
and a dictionary built on that reads as sourced when it is not.

A row whose fourth column is not a path is listed separately. Those are the
rows a person answered for, and they are read rather than checked.

Exit 0 when every path-sourced row checks out, 1 otherwise, 64 when there is
no config.
