#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Converts a batch of source documents into stamped Markdown.
#
# Walks the input tree one suite folder at a time, groups the files that are the
# same document in different formats, routes each group by the format of its
# richest member, and writes Markdown to the matching folder under the apps root.
# A source that converts and stamps without error moves to _done, so a rerun
# picks up only what is left. A suite's future folder, which holds the revisions
# the system does not carry yet, is walked as a suite folder of its own and
# lands in the same folder under the suite's output folder.
#
# Usage:
#   convert.sh --config FILE [--in DIR] [--out DIR] [--suite NAME] [--limit N]
#              [--dry-run] [--keep-sources] [--converted 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MMZ']
#
# FILE is the skill's extension.json (see convert_config.py). --in and --out
# default to its todoRoot and appsRoot, and a relative path is read from the
# top of the repository the file sits in.
