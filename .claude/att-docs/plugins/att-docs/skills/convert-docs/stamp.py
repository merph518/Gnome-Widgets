"""Cleans one converted Markdown file and stamps its provenance block.

Reads the Markdown that Pandoc produced plus the source documents it came from,
and writes the finished file. Standard library only: this box has no pip, no
openpyxl and no pandas, so the container formats are read as the zip archives
they are and the PDF properties come from pdftotext's sibling, pdfinfo.

Three jobs, in order. The cleanup pass takes Pandoc's output down to plain
Markdown: heading attributes, images, control characters and the escapes that
render as an em dash all come out, and the document's own headings shift down a
level so the title can occupy the single H1. The provenance pass then walks the
ladder for a revision date and a version, and labels each value with the rung it
came from, so a reader can tell a date the document stated from one the file
system remembers. It also links each source to its document in the SharePoint
library when the library path is known. The page pass, in pages.py, marks where
each page of the original starts.
