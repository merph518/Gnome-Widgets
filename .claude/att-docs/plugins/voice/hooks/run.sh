# Runs one voice-bridge-hooks script for a session in any repository. hooks.json calls it
# for every voice bridge hook, so the plugin's hooks work at user scope without the
# repository carrying a hook entry of its own.
#
# The repository's extension file is .claude/skills/voice-bridge-hooks/extension.json; a
# repository without one gets defaults.json. A repository whose own settings still
# register these scripts keeps them, and this runner steps aside so a hook never fires
# twice.

# The running bridge names the voice plugin folder it runs from in voice-bridge/plugin. Claude
# Code refreshes its installed copy of this plugin only when the version changes, so the
# runner hands the hook to that folder's runner instead, and the hooks run the same code as
# the bridge. With no bridge folder named, or one without a runner, the installed copy runs.
# The file and the runner it names must be this user's own, since without XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
# the folder sits in /tmp, where anyone could write one.
